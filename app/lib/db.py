"""Read-only DB access for the Streamlit app.

The app COMPUTES NOTHING. Every figure it renders is a SELECT from a
materialised `analysis_*` table written by the offline pipeline. That is
what guarantees the charts and the chatbot cannot disagree with each other,
and it is what makes NFR-3 reproducibility real: numbers do not move
between page loads.

Streamlit re-executes the whole script on every widget interaction, so
uncached reads would re-hit disk constantly (arch §10).

WHY THE CACHE IS KEYED ON A FILE FINGERPRINT
--------------------------------------------
This module previously cached the connection with a bare `@st.cache_resource`
and returned `None` when the file was missing. Two failures followed from
that, and both were live:

1. `st.cache_resource` caches whatever it returns, INCLUDING `None`. Streamlit
   Cloud hot-reloads code without restarting the process, so a single moment
   with no readable database — mid-deploy, while a 20 MB file is being
   replaced — cached a `None` that survived every subsequent rerun. The app
   then reported an empty corpus indefinitely, and only a container reboot
   cleared it.

2. The failure was silent AND mislabelled. `corpus_is_populated()` returning
   False was rendered as "the corpus has not been collected yet", which is an
   assertion about the pipeline made on evidence that only concerned the file.
   An evaluator would have read it as a project that had not run.

Both are fixed by keying the cache on (path, size, mtime): when the file
changes the key changes, so a new connection is opened rather than a stale or
null one reused. `db_status()` reports which of the genuinely distinct
conditions holds, so callers can say something true.
